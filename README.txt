Recommendation systems plays an important role in eÂ­commerce and online streaming services, such as Netflix, YouTube and Amazon. Usually recommendation systems are based on a rating scale from 1 to 5 grades or stars, with 1 indicating lowest satisfaction and 5 is the highest satisfaction.
The primary goal of recommendation systems is to help users find what they want based on their preferences and previous interactions, and predicting the rating for a new item. In this document, we create a movie rating system using the MovieLens dataset so that the user gets the best recommendation.
